# netfig
yet another network configlet generator 


define variables in jinja2 template with {{ variable }}

match those variables with the header of the csv, all values in the column will be used to fill out the template.

all files export to the current directory of the script, I will create afuntion to place them in a  specific path later with os path and input

all unfilled values are just empty strings

all files are named after the first column, so make that unique.


I will make a much better readme at another time.
